<CENTER><H1> <font size = "7" color = "blue">EASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY </font> </H1></CENTER>
<p> <font size = "5">Consistently ranked in the top third of Midwest universities in its class by U.S. News and World Report, Eastern has earned its reputation by offering a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate programs taught by an experienced and caring faculty. In addition to reasonable tuition, fees, and room and board rates, Eastern offers a textbook rental system, saving the average student hundreds of dollars per semester. </font> </p>
<p> <font size = "5">A variety of excellent on-campus housing opportunities are available on the safe, compact 320-acre campus. Student graduation and retention rates are well above state and national averages, and that success continues after students earn their degrees -- year after year, Eastern ranks high in job placement, alumni satisfaction and employer satisfaction. </font> </p>
<p> <font size = "5"> <strong> REAL EIU FACTS: </strong> If you talk to students, alumni, faculty and staff of Eastern Illinois University, before long you’ll start to notice a common theme: family. When you attend or work at Eastern, you’re doing more than just going to classes or showing up to a job. You become part of a family that supports each other, in good times and bad. Panther Pride doesn’t just have to do with athletics or wearing a blue shirt, it has to do with supporting each other – academically, personally, spiritually and sometimes even financially. Our impact can be local or global, but there is no doubt we have reason to be proud of being in this family that has produced some of the most impressive thinkers, workers and leaders the state of Illinois has ever seen. </font></p>
